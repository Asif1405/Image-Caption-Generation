# Image-Caption-Generation

### Overview:
In this final project we will define and train an image-to-caption model, that can produce descriptions for real world images!
Model architecture: CNN encoder and RNN decoder
We will use pre-trained InceptionV3 model for CNN encoder (https://research.googleblog.com/2016/03/train-your-own-image-classifier-with.html) and extract its last hidden layer as an embedding:
We will use encoder decoder architecture to generate captions.

### Requirements:
Python 3.x
